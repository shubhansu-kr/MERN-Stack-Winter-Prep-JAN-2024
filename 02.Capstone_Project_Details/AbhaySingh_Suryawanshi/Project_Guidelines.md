## Methodology to be Adopted to Solve the Problem
To address the identified challenges, our solution involves developing a web application using the MERN stack. The interactive user interface will be built with React, providing a seamless and engaging front-end experience. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, will manage user data and news content. MongoDB will serve as the database to store and organize essential user information, ensuring efficient data management for the personalized news consumption experience.
