    - TrackIt aims to address multiple aspects of an individual's life by providing a centralized platform for tracking and managing daily activities related to physical health, financial health, social relations, and task management. 
    
    - It seeks to simplify and streamline the process of monitoring and improving these key areas of life. 



- What are existing similar solutions?

    - MyFitnessPal or Cronometer for calorie and protein intake tracking.
    - Mint or YNAB for personal expense tracking.
    - Google Calendar or specialized reminder apps for events like birthdays and anniversaries.
    - Evernote or Microsoft OneNote for note-taking and task management.



- How do you want to solve it? 

    - TrackIt aims to provide a comprehensive solution by integrating all four aspects into a single, user-friendly MERN stack application. The mobile-friendly interface ensures accessibility, and the use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) facilitates efficient development and scalability. The application will utilize a clean and intuitive design to enhance the user experience.
