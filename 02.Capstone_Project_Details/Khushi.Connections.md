### Project Name: CONNECTIONS!!

- Which problem Project is Solving?

  - Helps to easily make new friends or find yourself a date; one can connect through chats, video-calls and group video-calls and chats for more than a group of two people. Many people face social anxiety due to which an individual cannot really talk to people present around them physically but they may be willing to text someone that's not present around them all the time and making new friends around the world would not just help them connect and be friends but they could also be helpful for each other's career growth (depends on how an individual chooses to use the application).
