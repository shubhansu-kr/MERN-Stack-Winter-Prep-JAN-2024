- Which problem Project is Solving?
    - The problem that my project is solving is Code Collaboration and Code Syncing. We often get wants to work
    collaboratively on a single project collaboratively and also at realtime. Though there are existing applications
    which works on this but some have project collaboration feature but some doesn't have realtime code-syncing features and vice-versa. 
    - Through this application user can work on a single code base and also make contributon to the existing project or repository. It also have the feature of realtime code-syncing
    - This application can also be used in a Interview Process for coding rounds and all.
