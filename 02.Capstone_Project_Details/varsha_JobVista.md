### Target Problem To Be Solved
The current job market is riddled with inefficiencies, creating challenges for both job seekers and employers. Traditional job boards lack personalization, resulting in a generic and often ineffective job search experience. Job seekers face difficulties in tracking applications and maintaining an organized search, while employers struggle with the overwhelming task of managing numerous applications.

The inefficient handling of job applications further complicates the process. Job seekers find it challenging to keep track of their submissions, and employers grapple with the management of a high volume of applications, leading to prolonged recruitment cycles and potential missed opportunities.
Moreover, the absence of user-friendly tools exacerbates the problem. Many job boards lack intuitive interfaces, hindering employers in posting listings and communicating with candidates, while job seekers encounter difficulties in navigating and applying to jobs.

Outdated technology compounds these challenges, resulting in slow response times and suboptimal user experiences. In light of these issues, there is a critical need for a modern Job Board Platform that leverages the MERN stack to offer a personalized, efficient, and user-centric solution. This platform aims to revolutionize the job search and recruitment experience, providing a dynamic environment that addresses the evolving needs of job seekers and employers.
