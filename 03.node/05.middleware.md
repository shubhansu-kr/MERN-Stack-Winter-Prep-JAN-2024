## Middlewares

Middlewares in Express.js are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. These functions can execute any code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack.

Here's a breakdown of their key characteristics and uses:

1. **Execution Order**: Middlewares are executed sequentially, following the order in which they are added in the Express app. This order is important because some middlewares might depend on the processing done by previous ones.

2. **Function Signature**: The typical signature of a middleware function is `(req, res, next)`, where:

   - `req` is the request object.
   - `res` is the response object.
   - `next` is a callback to the next middleware function.

3. **Types of Middlewares**:

   - **Application-level middleware**: Bound to an instance of `express`, using `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()`, where `METHOD` is the HTTP method (like `GET`, `POST`).
   - **Router-level middleware**: Similar to application-level middleware, but bound to an instance of `express.Router()`.
   - **Error-handling middleware**: Defined with four arguments `(err, req, res, next)`. It is used to handle errors in the app.
   - **Built-in middleware**: Comes bundled with Express, like `express.static` for serving static files.
   - **Third-party middleware**: External modules that can be integrated into the Express app, like `body-parser` for parsing request bodies.

4. **Use Cases**:

   - Parsing request bodies.
   - Logging requests.
   - Authenticating users.
   - Managing sessions.
   - Handling errors.
   - Setting response headers.

5. **Example**:
   Here's a simple middleware example:

   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log("Middleware executed!");
     next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
   });
   ```

In an Express app, middleware functions are crucial for handling HTTP requests, managing responses, and controlling the flow of request-response cycles. They add a layer of abstraction and modularity, making it easier to manage complex web applications.
