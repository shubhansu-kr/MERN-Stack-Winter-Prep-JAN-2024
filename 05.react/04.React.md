## Higher-order components

(HOCs) are a pattern in React that allows you to reuse component logic. However, with the introduction of React Hooks, especially the useEffect and useState hooks, you can often achieve the same results without the need for HOCs. Whether you should use HOCs in a functional component or not depends on your specific use case and coding preferences.

### Here are some considerations:

- Hooks: React Hooks are now the recommended way to manage state and side effects in functional components. If you can achieve your desired functionality using hooks, it's generally a more straightforward and modern approach.

- HOCs for Cross-Cutting Concerns: HOCs can still be useful for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, routing, or data fetching, especially if you have many components that need the same logic. However, consider alternatives like React context and custom hooks for some of these cases.

- Readability and Maintainability: HOCs can sometimes make code harder to read and understand, especially when multiple HOCs are composed together. Hooks can lead to more concise and readable code in many cases.

- Reusability: HOCs are great for encapsulating and reusing logic across different components. If you have specific reusable logic that you plan to use in multiple places, HOCs might make sense.

- Community Standards: React has evolved over time, and many new libraries and patterns have emerged. It's essential to consider what is considered best practice within the React community at the time you are working on your project.

- Function as Child Components and Render Props: In some cases, you might find that using a function as a child component or render props pattern provides a more flexible and intuitive way to share behavior between components.

- Custom Hooks: Custom hooks are a powerful way to encapsulate and share component logic. If you find yourself repeatedly using the same logic in multiple components, consider creating a custom hook.

In summary, HOCs can still be useful in some situations, but with the advent of React Hooks and other modern patterns, you should consider the specific requirements of your project and whether there are more up-to-date alternatives that provide cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Pure Component

In JavaScript, a pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input values. For example, the following function is pure because it always returns the same result for the same x and y values:

In React, a pure component is a component that produces the same output for the same props and state. Pure components are optimized for performance because they only re-render when their props or state change.

In React, "Pure Components" refer to class components that inherit from React.PureComponent and automatically perform a shallow comparison of props and state to determine whether a component should re-render. However, in functional components, you don't have the concept of "Pure Components" as you do in class components.

In functional components, you can achieve similar optimizations by using the React.memo higher-order component or the useMemo hook. These tools can help prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props or state of a functional component haven't changed.

Here's how you can use them:

### React.memo (Functional Component)

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  // Component logic here
});

export default MyComponent;
```

React.memo will memoize the component and re-render it only when its props change.

### useMemo (Functional Component)

```
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

const MyComponent = (props) => {
  // Component logic here

  // Memoize a value or component to prevent re-renders
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeValue(props), [props]);

  return (
    // JSX using memoizedValue
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

```

useMemo allows you to memoize a specific value or component, and it re-computes the memoized value only when the dependencies (in this case, props) change.

So, while you don't use "Pure Components" in functional components, you can achieve similar optimization goals by using React.memo or useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when needed. These tools help ensure that your functional components only re-render when their inputs change, improving performance and reducing unnecessary work.
